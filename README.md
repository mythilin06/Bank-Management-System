**Bank Management System**  
This project is a C++ application designed to streamline banking operations with a focus on security, efficiency, and user-friendly functionalities. The system incorporates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage:  

- **Account Creation**  
- **Deposits and Withdrawals**  
- **Funds Transfers**  
- **Transaction History Viewing**  

 **Features** :  
- **Encapsulation** ensures secure handling of sensitive data like passwords and account details.  
- **Modular Design** allows for future extensions, such as adding new account types.  
- **Abstraction and Polymorphism** simplify operations through intuitive methods.  
- **Secure Access** to account information with password verification.  
- **Transaction Tracking** for detailed financial record-keeping.  

This repository includes the complete source code and documentation to help users understand and extend the project further. Ideal for learning OOP principles and creating real-world applications.
